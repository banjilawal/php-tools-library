THE SUPERMODEL NAMESPACE
-------------------------
This contains classes and interfaces that can be inherited or implemented when creating models that are frequently used across projects.
It contains concrete classes for phone numbers, postal addresses, and credit cards.  Many web applications tend to be stores so most of
the abstract classes and interfaces are related to shopping carts.  There is a Person class which can be inherited for creating customers.
