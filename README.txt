PHP-Library README
-------------------

Introduction
------------

The library is mainly a set of tools for testing php applications. It also contains abstract classes, interfaces, and ordinary classes that are frequently used in php projets. Eventually I would like it 
to automate the layout of all php projects 

Goals
-------

1.	Centralize logging
2.	Have consistent behavior and APIs across all projects
3.	Have a consistent file architecture and layout for all projects
